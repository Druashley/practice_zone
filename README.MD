12-22-19: This is going to be an area where I log and store the information I am practicing. My goal is to use this as a cheatsheet for things I have been practicing. More or less my notes ~

12-22-19: Finished working on ARRAYS - It went really well. Happy with how the test went at the end of. https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp - Next step is Loop practice

12-23-19: https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises Here is a link of exercises I am working on. Here is the order Odin wants me to work on them; 1) helloWorld 2) repeatString 3) reverseString 4)removeFromArray 5) sumAll 6)leapYears 7)tempConversion. 

12-23-19: Last night and into today I read up on loops. While I feel like I can understand the syntax easiler, formulating a problem on my own can be quite difficult. This is something I hope to get better at. I finished exercise #2 repeatString. This combined a function with two variables, inside the function an if/else statement, and then inside that was a while loop! Very fun! While the code is small, it seems pretty dense!  

12-24-19: It is Chirstmas Eve. Won't be doing much today. Wrote a for loop in the Loopprace file. Just for some quick practice. I was able to do this without looking at any notes!

12-26-19: Chirstmas was great. Excited to get back into learning! today I am going to recap on some of the things I have learned this far. Not going to do too much. I may work on the odinproject javascript exercieses. I have only completed the first two. I may start the third today.

12-26-19: I was able to complete the reverse string! I am very proud of myself! 

12-27-19: Worked on some more loops. Trying to create a loop that will take some arguments, create an array, and then remove any given string out of the array. It has been a bit d ifficult so far. But I feel like my solution is right around the corner. Taking a break for now. Worked for 2 hours.

12-28-19: Worked on removing a given string from an array. Figured out how to do it. But I am having difficulties having the function accept multiple strings to be removed. Taking a break for nbow. Worked for about 2 hours!

12-29-19: Going to stream my learning session today! Hopefully will get past this array problem!

12-29-19: Worked for about 3 hours! Got a bunch done! Learned "||" and got to the last exercise in the Javascript-exercises on the odin project. Will keep pushing forward!

12-30-19: Starting my coding day at 1:37. hoping to go until about 4PM! Going to do my best to finish the last two exercises.

12-30-19: Finished today with a bunch done! Finished the rest of the javascript exercises. Really happy with how strong I was able to finish the tasks. Last few did not take that long IMO. Streamed for 3 hours today! and I am writing this at 4:33PM! Another great day in the bags. Happy, motivated, and looking forward to coding tomorrow! 

12-31-19: It is the last day of the year! A new decade ahead! Lets finish strong with a little coding. I will work on DOM manipulation today. This topic seems very dense! But I know I can learn it with enough time.
