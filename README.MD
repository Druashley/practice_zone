12-22-19: This is going to be an area where I log and store the information I am practicing. My goal is to use this as a cheatsheet for things I have been practicing. More or less my notes ~

12-22-19: Finished working on ARRAYS - It went really well. Happy with how the test went at the end of. https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp - Next step is Loop practice

12-23-19: https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises Here is a link of exercises I am working on. Here is the order Odin wants me to work on them; 1) helloWorld 2) repeatString 3) reverseString 4)removeFromArray 5) sumAll 6)leapYears 7)tempConversion. 

12-23-19: Last night and into today I read up on loops. While I feel like I can understand the syntax easiler, formulating a problem on my own can be quite difficult. This is something I hope to get better at. I finished exercise #2 repeatString. This combined a function with two variables, inside the function an if/else statement, and then inside that was a while loop! Very fun! While the code is small, it seems pretty dense!  

12-24-19: It is Chirstmas Eve. Won't be doing much today. Wrote a for loop in the Loopprace file. Just for some quick practice. I was able to do this without looking at any notes!

12-26-19: Chirstmas was great. Excited to get back into learning! today I am going to recap on some of the things I have learned this far. Not going to do too much. I may work on the odinproject javascript exercieses. I have only completed the first two. I may start the third today.

12-26-19: I was able to complete the reverse string! I am very proud of myself! 

12-27-19: Worked on some more loops. Trying to create a loop that will take some arguments, create an array, and then remove any given string out of the array. It has been a bit d ifficult so far. But I feel like my solution is right around the corner. Taking a break for now. Worked for 2 hours.

12-28-19: Worked on removing a given string from an array. Figured out how to do it. But I am having difficulties having the function accept multiple strings to be removed. Taking a break for nbow. Worked for about 2 hours!

12-29-19: Going to stream my learning session today! Hopefully will get past this array problem!

12-29-19: Worked for about 3 hours! Got a bunch done! Learned "||" and got to the last exercise in the Javascript-exercises on the odin project. Will keep pushing forward!

12-30-19: Starting my coding day at 1:37. hoping to go until about 4PM! Going to do my best to finish the last two exercises.

12-30-19: Finished today with a bunch done! Finished the rest of the javascript exercises. Really happy with how strong I was able to finish the tasks. Last few did not take that long IMO. Streamed for 3 hours today! and I am writing this at 4:33PM! Another great day in the bags. Happy, motivated, and looking forward to coding tomorrow! 

12-31-19: It is the last day of the year! A new decade ahead! Lets finish strong with a little coding. I will work on DOM manipulation today. This topic seems very dense! But I know I can learn it with enough time.

12-31-19: Coded for 3 hours! Learned a ton about DOM Manipulation. Clearly this is going to be huge! Very happy with what my brain was able to understand today! Also did the first javascript 30 exercise that the odin project recommended. This will be something I will want to return to. I was able to replicate but it would be very difficult to generate a similar project on my own. #GOALS

1-1-20: NEW YEAR NEW ME! Getting a late night practice sesh in. Starting at 6:15PM. Ducks won the Rose Bowl today against WI.

1-1-20: With some help from MysticSeagull and ImExplosive, recreated the Rock, Paper, Scissors game (aka v2)! Super happy with the results. Tomorrow I am going to focus on CSS adjustments of this project and  then I will merge it into the odin project's directory!! Lets send it! Finished around 9:37PM. A good 3 hours in the bag! Streamed the sesh!

1-2-20: I will be cleaning up the RPSv2 project that was more or less completed last night. Hoping to make it look decent. I want to add some CSS and HTML to the project. Starting at 1:18PM and I am streaming today.

1-2-20: Finished coding at 4:35PM! Finshed the RPSv2 project and uploaded it to the answer's on the Odin's git! Very happy with the results. Learned a ton from it. Next project for the odin project is an Etch-A-Sketch. This task looks like it is going to be very involved. Got a good start on it today, will take multiple sessions for me to complete it. 

1-3-20: Starting to code today at 12:47. Feeling great! Today I will start to really build this Etch-a-Sketch program. Time to learn! Hoping to code for 2 - 4 hours today. Also, added 3 panels on my twitch for basic info!

1-3-20: Huge steps made in the Etch-a-Sketch project. Learned a great deal about eventlisteners, and using a grid. Tons of more to learn, but getting better everyday! Stopped at 4:59PM. So a good 4 hour day in the bags! 

1-4-20: Starting to c ode around 12:05PM. Today I am hoping to finish this Etch-a-Sketch project. It is pretty much done now. Hoping to add a few more things today.

1-4-20: Finished the Etch a Sketch. Added some other features to it that I am proud of. Next up I will be learning about objects in more detail. Very confusing so far, but I think I will get the hang of it. Worked until 3:04 for about a total of 3 hours today! Looking forward to tomorrow.

1-5-20: Happy sunday! Working on some mroe javascript exercises from the odin project. https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises . Calculator, palindromes, caesar, fibonacci, geTheTitles, findTheOldest are all of the exercises I need to do. I am hoping to compelte these within a few days(2-3). Today will be a short stream and coding session, hoping to get about 2 hours in. Today's start time is 11:53AM.

1-5-20: Finishing up today's session at 2:05PM. Today went pretty good. Finished the calc and palindrome exercises. Lots of more practice to be had. 

1-6-20: Going to continue on learning objects. I have watched a few videos over the last few days on the topic, I want to go more in-depth today. I will probably do one exercise after! Starting the stream at 2:07PM.
