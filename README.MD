12-23-19: Last night and into today I read up on loops. While I feel like I can understand the syntax easiler, formulating a problem on my own can be quite difficult. This is something I hope to get better at. I finished exercise #2 repeatString. This combined a function with two variables, inside the function an if/else statement, and then inside that was a while loop! Very fun! While the code is small, it seems pretty dense!
