12-22-19: This is going to be an area where I log and store the information I am practicing. My goal is to use this as a cheatsheet for things I have been practicing. More or less my notes ~

12-22-19: Finished working on ARRAYS - It went really well. Happy with how the test went at the end of. https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp - Next step is Loop practice

12-23-19: https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises Here is a link of exercises I am working on. Here is the order Odin wants me to work on them; 1) helloWorld 2) repeatString 3) reverseString 4)removeFromArray 5) sumAll 6)leapYears 7)tempConversion. 

12-23-19: Last night and into today I read up on loops. While I feel like I can understand the syntax easiler, formulating a problem on my own can be quite difficult. This is something I hope to get better at. I finished exercise #2 repeatString. This combined a function with two variables, inside the function an if/else statement, and then inside that was a while loop! Very fun! While the code is small, it seems pretty dense!  

12-24-19: It is Chirstmas Eve. Won't be doing much today. Wrote a for loop in the Loopprace file. Just for some quick practice. I was able to do this without looking at any notes!

12-26-19: Chirstmas was great. Excited to get back into learning! today I am going to recap on some of the things I have learned this far. Not going to do too much. I may work on the odinproject javascript exercieses. I have only completed the first two. I may start the third today.

12-26-19: I was able to complete the reverse string! I am very proud of myself! 

12-27-19: Worked on some more loops. Trying to create a loop that will take some arguments, create an array, and then remove any given string out of the array. It has been a bit d ifficult so far. But I feel like my solution is right around the corner. Taking a break for now. Worked for 2 hours.

12-28-19: Worked on removing a given string from an array. Figured out how to do it. But I am having difficulties having the function accept multiple strings to be removed. Taking a break for nbow. Worked for about 2 hours!

12-29-19: Going to stream my learning session today! Hopefully will get past this array problem!

12-29-19: Worked for about 3 hours! Got a bunch done! Learned "||" and got to the last exercise in the Javascript-exercises on the odin project. Will keep pushing forward!

12-30-19: Starting my coding day at 1:37. hoping to go until about 4PM! Going to do my best to finish the last two exercises.

12-30-19: Finished today with a bunch done! Finished the rest of the javascript exercises. Really happy with how strong I was able to finish the tasks. Last few did not take that long IMO. Streamed for 3 hours today! and I am writing this at 4:33PM! Another great day in the bags. Happy, motivated, and looking forward to coding tomorrow! 

12-31-19: It is the last day of the year! A new decade ahead! Lets finish strong with a little coding. I will work on DOM manipulation today. This topic seems very dense! But I know I can learn it with enough time.

12-31-19: Coded for 3 hours! Learned a ton about DOM Manipulation. Clearly this is going to be huge! Very happy with what my brain was able to understand today! Also did the first javascript 30 exercise that the odin project recommended. This will be something I will want to return to. I was able to replicate but it would be very difficult to generate a similar project on my own. #GOALS

1-1-20: NEW YEAR NEW ME! Getting a late night practice sesh in. Starting at 6:15PM. Ducks won the Rose Bowl today against WI.

1-1-20: With some help from MysticSeagull and ImExplosive, recreated the Rock, Paper, Scissors game (aka v2)! Super happy with the results. Tomorrow I am going to focus on CSS adjustments of this project and  then I will merge it into the odin project's directory!! Lets send it! Finished around 9:37PM. A good 3 hours in the bag! Streamed the sesh!

1-2-20: I will be cleaning up the RPSv2 project that was more or less completed last night. Hoping to make it look decent. I want to add some CSS and HTML to the project. Starting at 1:18PM and I am streaming today.

1-2-20: Finished coding at 4:35PM! Finshed the RPSv2 project and uploaded it to the answer's on the Odin's git! Very happy with the results. Learned a ton from it. Next project for the odin project is an Etch-A-Sketch. This task looks like it is going to be very involved. Got a good start on it today, will take multiple sessions for me to complete it. 

1-3-20: Starting to code today at 12:47. Feeling great! Today I will start to really build this Etch-a-Sketch program. Time to learn! Hoping to code for 2 - 4 hours today. Also, added 3 panels on my twitch for basic info!

1-3-20: Huge steps made in the Etch-a-Sketch project. Learned a great deal about eventlisteners, and using a grid. Tons of more to learn, but getting better everyday! Stopped at 4:59PM. So a good 4 hour day in the bags! 

1-4-20: Starting to c ode around 12:05PM. Today I am hoping to finish this Etch-a-Sketch project. It is pretty much done now. Hoping to add a few more things today.

1-4-20: Finished the Etch a Sketch. Added some other features to it that I am proud of. Next up I will be learning about objects in more detail. Very confusing so far, but I think I will get the hang of it. Worked until 3:04 for about a total of 3 hours today! Looking forward to tomorrow.

1-5-20: Happy sunday! Working on some mroe javascript exercises from the odin project. https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises . Calculator, palindromes, caesar, fibonacci, geTheTitles, findTheOldest are all of the exercises I need to do. I am hoping to compelte these within a few days(2-3). Today will be a short stream and coding session, hoping to get about 2 hours in. Today's start time is 11:53AM.

1-5-20: Finishing up today's session at 2:05PM. Today went pretty good. Finished the calc and palindrome exercises. Lots of more practice to be had. 

1-6-20: Going to continue on learning objects. I have watched a few videos over the last few days on the topic, I want to go more in-depth today. I will probably do one exercise after! Starting the stream at 2:07PM.

1-6-20: Stopping at 4:23 today. Rough day. I tried to work on the Caesar's problem in the javascript exercises and my brain nearly blew up. Going to watch some videos on the topic off stream and get back at it tomorrow. I have a lot of work ahead of me. I am enjoying it though. 

1-7-20: Went through a few codewars projects today. Also, last night and this morning I created a rpg style game. I will be adding this to github later on. Thank you to Barry, Mystic, and Graceful for helping out today. Did a 3 and a half hour stream!  

1-8-20: Today's goal is to work on some codewars. Had a great idea of turning this readme file into a simple website. I already use it like a journal and I have the skills now to put something together. Continuing to take break on the Odin Project for the time being. Using my time at the moment to practice what I have learned.

1-8-20: Today went great. Impressed with how far the Journal project has went. I am going to have to learn about file storage now. Hopefully within a week I will be able to have my journal completed over there. Shout out to crowprogramming, Acocordingtobo, Mysticseagull, iamgotenks for hanging out! 167 minutes streamed.

1-9-20: Watched a ton of videos after stream last night and this morning. Bo send a crazy mockup of the journal project I am trying to create. He used a lot of things I can learn from. Starting today at 1:50PM.

1-9-20: Finished two codewar problems. Starting to feel better about my problem solving. I still have a long way to go. Thanks to Bo, Potato, Danyonks, and Int for hanging out.  Worked for 210 minutes. 

1-10-20: Might be a short day today. I'll probably do a few code wars and see how I am feeling after that.

1-10-20: Had a great day coding and streaming. Feeling better with the codewars. Still a million miles ahead of me to learn. Looking forward to it. Was able to refactor one code problem really well. Super proud. Worked for 205 minutes today.

1-11-20: Fun day ahead! Looking to code for about 2-3 hours today. Going to focus again on codewars for the moment. I really feel like these are helping me train a lot of the material i have learned.

1-11-20: What a day! bashed my head into the wall working on my first kyu 6. Finished it because of the help from Potato and others! Learned a lot. I need to spend some time learning the reduce method and master it. Quote from Gracefulpotato - "reduce is used when you have an array of values and you want to combine these values somehow in one" Worked for 195 minutes today.

1-12-20: Got a wonderful start on the calc app for TOP. It pretty much works. I need to add a clear function. I need to add a decimal point to the project. I also need to clear up some errors. Coded for 260 minutes today. Things are looking great!

1-13-20: Yesterday may have been the best day yet coding! Things were clicking and huge steps were made in the calc project. I know the tasks that I completed this far are not the most difficult, but seeing my ability to complete those tasks was huge boost in my ego. Today I will continue with the calc project. I need to add some new buttons to it and a few other things. Starting at 1:20PM!

1-13-20: worked until 5:04PM. Nearly all major functions of the calc work! Shout out to everyone whoe helped out! Very very very happy with how things went. Looking forward to tomorrow! Worked for 220 minutes.

1-14-20: Today marks 4 weeks of learning ! It has been a great journey. I am looking forward to the next steps! I am not sure what I will be doing today. The calc project is done for the most part. So I think I need to just continue through TOP. Should be a lot of reading and learning today!

1-14-20: Got started on Object Constructors - very interesting. I learned a lot. thank you seagull, and potato for kicking my butt and helping me understand what I was reading. I can tell this will take quite a few hours for me to understand. That is okay. I will get more comfortable with it as time passes. Once again, today marked 28 days (4 weeks) of coding. Coudn't be happier with how I am doing. Thank you everyone. Time worked 240 minutes.

1-15-20: Late start today. Had things to do. Looking forward to working on more Object Constructors! This library project has been fun so far. 

1-15-20: Worked on the library project the entire time. It is going pretty well. Bo helped me learn about class attributes. These seem very strong. I also was able to use console.log to really dig deep into some objects / elements. This is very satisfying. Looking forward to tomorrow's stream. Today I worked for 275 minutes. I think this was my longest stream yet.

1-16-20: Almost done with this library project! Should be able to finish it up! I have learned a ton about objects via this project.

1-16-20: Got started on a tic tac toe project. I expect this to take 20 hours or so to get worked out. Factory Functions blew my mind today. I have little understanding on how they fully work. I need to watch and read a bunch more on them. Hopefully I can understand them within a week or so. Today marked 30 days coding. What a ride it has been thus far. Worked for 260 minutes.

1-17-20: Today will be a practice day. Going to focus on the iffy things and factory functions I learned yesterday. Will return to the tic tac toe project later once I have praacticed a few days. Might do some codewars today or over the weekend. 

1-17-20: Still having trouble understanding factories. Potato helped me a lot today in breaking them down. I feel like after a few more hours I will start to understand them muchc better. I also worked on the tic-tac-toe project. I struggled at the start of working on it, but started picking up some steam as I Went. I need to make the ruleset next to check for a winner after a move is made. I worked for 210 minutes today.

1-18-20: Another great day of coding ahead. I will be tackling the coding project again today. I really think I should be able to get a lot more backend stuff done today. Namely, I would like to get the logic for picking a winner determined. I know it is going to be hard figure out, but I think I can do it! 

1-18-20: worked on the tic tac toe project. I was able to complete quite a few things today! Refactor'd some of the code already. Specifically, I made a character creation factory and it works great. I have to add a reset button still. I tried to do this for a bit, but could not make it work. I also need to create  a 'win-state-screen' for example, the text at the top is the only thing that changes at the moment. I would like for this win screen to be more impactful. Coded for 200 minutes today.

1-19-20: BOOM tic tac toe's logic has been completed! I have built out just about everything needed for a tic tac toe game. Very happy with how to process went. Took a few days to get the project to this point, but I have put together a lot of useful techniques in it! Tomorrow I hope to make it pretty. Going to focus on the CSS of the project tomorrow. Ending up doing some css work later at night for another hour. Still have so much to learn CSS and HTML. I would say my general understanding of Javascript helps me understand css and html ideas much easier. Worked for 183 mintues today! 

1-20-20: Starting my day late at 6PM. Today I am going to focus on cleaning up the tic tac toe project! 

1-20-20: Finished the tic tac toe project for now. Learned a crap ton from it. I made a randomizer to pick spots. I did not put it in the html though. It just exists in the js file. I started learning about es6 today. Classes semed a bit confusing, I bet it will take a few weeks to understand that like the rest of this stuff has. Next I learned about npx webpackage. Took me 50 minutes just to figure out that I had a spelling error compared to the example I was working off. That was funny. rough though. Happy with how today went. Excited for whats to come. These modules seem critical to my succsess. Looking forward to coding tomorrow. Worked for 180 minutes today. 

1-21-20: Starting today at 11:35PM. Feeling pretty tired at the moment. I am taking a step back from what I was working on yesterday and getting back at the main track web dev 101 on TOP. It looks like I will be doing a bit of ruby today. Worked for about 60 minutes on this. Going to stop here for now, and get the stream going. I will probably recreate that journal idea I had before using the techniques I have learned this far. I may also do some codewars. not sure yet.

1-21-20: Tried to set up the journal with some backend server stuff. VERY VERY confusing. Tons to learn. Thank you Bo, Potato, and Seagull for helping me out as much as they could. Worked for another 3 hours on this.

1-22-20: Today was my first day besides christmas that I did not code super hard. I did two codewars problems. A level 7 and a level 8. Nothing crazy, but I wanted to get something done. I coded for about 45 minutes. A very light day.

1-23-20: Late night stream tonight. Not sure what I am going to work on. Maybe just some code wars! worked on a few problems for a bit. Got a little bit done. Nothing crazy. Happy with how things went! Worked for 110 minutes today.  Tomorrow I start going hard again! 

1-24-20: Happy Freaking Friday, not sure what the goal is for today. I would like to continue practicing some code. Maybe do some codewars or maybe continue on TOP. Lets make the most of the day!

1-24-20: Today was a good day coding. I need to dedicate the next few hours to really understand es6 modules. I believe I Can do it with enough time. spend 210 minutes coding today.

1-25-20: Raise hell praise dale! Going to work on understanding es6 modules all day. Lets kick butt! 

1-25-20: Feeling much better about ES6 modules after working on them. I finished another kyu 6 on codewars. With some help from glEnd and Bo I was able to refactor it to one line! Very happy about that. Going to get started on the resturant page tomorrow for TOP. I am thinking it will take me about 4 days to complete this project! worked for 130 minutes today.

1-26-20: Crazy day. Sad day for basketball. I am going to code for around 2 hours today. I plan to get started on this resturant page today.

1-26-20: Worked on the restaurant page for TOP. I am able to use ES6 modules really well thus far. Next up I  will be making event listeners to the links to reset the page and update the body contents. Really happy with what I was able to make today! Spent 210 minutes working today.

1-27-20: Lets make today great. Yesterday's shock in the basketball world motivates me to be great. No reason not to give this coding thing a real shot. Excited to work on this resturant page some more. I got a bunch more to do with it, but for now it is looking pretty great!.

1-27-20: Worked on the KETO JOES page for a bit. I was able to create a lot of on event listeners today. The website is coming along very nicely. Looking forward to coding tomorrow. Worked for 220 minutes today.

1-28-20: Another day! Lets get the rest of this KETO JOES page flushed out. I would like to maybe get to adding some 'fun' things to it by tomorrow or the end of today. Feeling fairly weak today, I am not sure how long I will code. 

1-28:20: Worked on codewars after finishing up KETO JOES. Looked at some of the other TOP people's pages. Honestly, mine does not look that bad! I am very happy with what I made! Coded for 170 minutes today. Back at it again tomorrow.

1-29-20: What to do... Not sure what I want to work on today. The next assignment on TOP is a to-do list. I really feel as if I need to spend a couple days practicing what I have been learning. I might try and add some content to the KETO JOES website to practice some of these skills. I am not sure what I could add though. 

1-29-20: Got my first Asych API thing set up for KETO JOES. Super happy with the results. It pulls three things from an API. An image, a name, and a description. I used this to create a 'recipe showcase' tab on the website. Really happy with all of the skills  I learned to do it. Shoutout to Jackzeys for helping me understand the api fetch and all of that jazz! Thanks to Eiswine again for the promotion ! worked for 230 minutes today! Back at it again tomorrow. Tomorrow I Want to start with the codewars wub problem.

1-30-20: Today has been a great Thursday! Looking forward to a day of coding. I am thinking I will continue on some codewars and maybe work on the menu page on Keto Joes!

1-30-20: Short stream today. I have a bunch of reading to do. Done with KETO JOES for now. Super pumped with how it turned out. Got it posted github now too! Hopefully will get through the reading tonight / tomorrow morning. Worked for 105 minutes today.

1-31-20: Focusing on codewars today. Probably won't stream for too too long.  Both of these statements turned out to be lies lol! Created a wow target tracket! Very happy with what it does. I still have to stylize it and work some other features. But for 3 hours of work, I am blown away at what was able to be made.Back at it again tomorrow. Worked for 198 minutes today. 

2-1-20: First day of February! Tomorrow is the super bowl. Going to continue to work on thie wow raid tracker thing. Happy with what I got done yesterday. Stylized the wow tracker. Happy with what I was able to put together. This is the first thing I have made that doesn't look too bad lol. Adding a background to the html on repeat and then giving divs a transparent effect is pretty cool! I am sure I will use this in the future. Worked for 120 minutes today. 

2-3-20: Took yesterday off to watch the superbowl. What a great game! KC won it. Today I am going to focus on adding some more features to the wow raid thingy I have made. I also have a job interview tomorrow! Very excited for that. Made my biggest object builder to date for the project today! Very happy! glEnd2 was a huge help during that. Also, thank you to Jujuju2 for coming in and helping me out. Learning and using new techniques every day! Also, learned about the 'get' command. Worked for 210 minutes today.

2-4-20: Happy freaking Tuesday! Pumped for the future! Moving forward I will have to stream a little later. Going to work on the raid target tracker more today. Short stream today, since I start work tomorrow. Worked on the wow page some more. Made a copy paste button and added my first transition animation with the help of glEnd2. Worked for 70 minutes today!

2-7-20: What a crazy last 3 days! Had an interview Tuesday, start the job on Wednesday. Couldn't sleep tuesday night because I Was so excited. Therefore, when I got home tuesday I did not stream. The next day, I did not stream because of raid. This is the longest time period I have went without coding since I started. So excited to get in a simpel session today. I still wont stream. Just going to review since I have little time. Today is Friday and I want to take bae out to dinner and celebrate us both starting new jobs this week! Created factory for bosses. I will have to rework the reminder page because I made it into an es6 module at the end of my coding sesh. Worked for 95 minutes.

2-8-20: Back into the swing of things! Going to continue working on this wow target tracker page. This past Thursday was the first time I got to use it. I thought it was helpful. Who knows what the raid thought of it. Coded for 100 minutes today.

2-10-20: Was feeling a bit sick yesterday and did not code. Ready to get back into a groove since starting my new job. I will probably do just simple codewars for tonight. 

2-10-20: Did codewars for 90 minutes. Feeling good. Don't want to get burnt out with the new job and coding. Easing back into coding after having a wild past week. worked for 100 minutes.
